Optimal Strategies for Elephant Population Management Using Contraceptive Darting Simulation

In this project, I simulated the elephant population in Kruger National Park, South Africa. The park's carrying capacity is approximately 7000 elephants (1 elephant per square mile of park). Previous efforts to manage the population involved culling approximately 400 animals per year. After the development of an elephant contraceptive, the current effort to manage the population involves using a contraceptive dart on adult female elephants to limit the birth rate.

Abstract: 
The context of this project is the management of elephant populations through contraceptive darting to maintain ecological balance. To understand the optimal strategies, we simulated different scenarios, varying key survival parameters of elephants (such as adult and senior survival probabilities) to observe how these affect the effectiveness of darting probabilities. We applied core computer science concepts like loops, and conditional logic to model population dynamics accurately. Our key findings reveal that as certain survival probabilities increase, the darting probability needed for population control must be adjusted accordingly to achieve desired conservation outcomes.

Methods: 
We utilized a computational approach to model the effects of contraceptive darting on elephant population dynamics. A key aspect of our computational thinking involved iteratively running simulations with varying survival probabilities and measuring their impact. One of the challenges we faced was managing large datasets and ensuring our code ran efficiently. We tackled this by implementing optimized loops and modular functions to handle calculations. The choice of using conditional statements was crucial, as it allowed us to simulate different reproductive and survival outcomes based on probability thresholds, reflecting real-world variability in elephant populations.
